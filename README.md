Hi, today i'm here to realase a ped sistem which works through db.
Read the note on the code for understand how it work.
There are two command, the first is "setped", the command for set the ped to a player and the arguments of the command are the player to whose you want to set the ped and the stream name of the ped. The second command is resetped, the command for remove a ped from a player and the arguments of the command is only the player to whose you want reset the ped. On the code u will find more note btw.
 I hope you 'il like it. I'm sorry for my bad english but i'm italian xD.
